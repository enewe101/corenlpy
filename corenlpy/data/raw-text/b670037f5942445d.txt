President Carlos Menem has no plans to meet with the controversial
leader of the Unification Church, Reverend Sun Myung Moon, who will
launch a magazine here this weekend, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella
said Thursday.

"This is a free country and Mr. Moon can talk to whomever he wants
(but) a meeting with Mr. Moon is not on the president's agenda," Di
Tella said.

Moon, a business magnate and media mogul of South Korean origin,
invited Menem to the official launching of his weekly magazine Tiempos
del Mundo.

Also on the guest list are former US president George Bush and former
Peruvian president Francisco Morales Bermudez.

Moon, who claims to be the son of God and says hew has several million
followers -- better known as "Moonies" -- has embarked on a mission he
calls the South America project, which includes investments in
Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.
