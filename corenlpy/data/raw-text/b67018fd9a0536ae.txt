Zimbabwe were strongly placed on the third
day of the second and final Test against Bangladesh Sunday despite
losing an early wicket in their second innings.

The tourists were 36-1 at lunch with an overall lead of 123 runs
and nine wickets in hand. Barney Rogers was on 20 batting with Dion
Ebrahim (one) at the break.

Opener Stuart Matsikenyeri, who scored a half-century in the
first innings, was trapped leg-before by fast bowler Mashrafe
Mortaza after making 14.

Bangladesh, resuming at 169-8, were earlier Sunday all out for
211 in their first innings in reply to Zimbabwe's 298.

The Bangladeshi tail-enders defied the Zimbabwean attack for
more than an hour in the morning session, with Mortaza (26) and
Tapash Baisya (13) making useful contributions.

Fast bowler Tinashe Panyangara and leg-spinner Graeme Cremer
shared the last two Bangladeshi wickets.

Fast bowler Douglas Hondo finished with a career-best 6-59 for
Zimbabwe, who are hoping to square the two-match series following
their 226-run defeat in the opening Test at Chittagong.
