With a 1-1 overall tie after the first two meets, China's top
universities Qinghua and Beijing will vie for the honor for the third
time in their annual inter- university boat race here in May.

Both sides have attached great importance to the May 26 race on the
Kunyu River in the Chinese capital, with theri crews starting training
under professional coaches as early as the end of last year.

The race between China's two most prestigious universities is a
newcomer compared to the established annual Oxford-Cambrige Boat Race
which dates from 1829.

Beijing University won the first version of the boat race while Qinghua
evened the series 1-1 with their victory at last year's race.
