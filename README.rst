Corenlpy documentation
======================

.. py:module:: corenlpy

Purpose
-------

Stanford's CoreNLP tool suite is a full-featured tool for generating 
annotations in text like POS (part-of-speech) tags and the dependency 
parse.

This package is designed to make working with CoreNLP a bit easier for
Python users.  The main gain is in working with the annotated
output from CoreNLP, but this package also makes it easy to call CoreNLP 
from within Python.

The CoreNLP tool can output the annotations to xml files.  
Working with these files is a bit tricky: it's up to the reading
program to rebuild the logical links between the various kinds of
information (e.g. POS, parse, and coreference information, etc).  

The format also has some questionable aspects.  It uses one-based indexing 
for sentence and token ids, while character offsets are zero-based.
Also, named entities and coreference chains don't have a consistent
relationship to one another.

The ``corenlpy.AnnotatedText`` class provides an API in Python that 
simplifies access to CoreNLP's annotations and traversal of the annotated
document, while ironing out some of the inconsistencies.

CoreNLP can be fairly easily run from the commandline.  But, you may
prefer to use the ``corenlpy.corenlp()`` function to invoke it from
within Python.  This can make it a bit easier, for example, to make
a script that processes all the files in several directories.


Install
-------

Basic install: ``pip install corenlpy``

Hackable install: 

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/enewe101/corenlpy.git
   cd corenlpy
   python setup.py develop


Run CoreNLP in python
---------------------
CoreNLP is easy to run from the commandline.  However, if you want to run
it on many files in different directories, or integrate it with other 
scripting logic, it may be easier to invoke it within Python.  This package
simplifies running CoreNLP in that case.  This isn't a "wrapper" because
it is really just invoking CoreNLP through a system call, which you could
do yourself on the commandline.

You will need to download and unzip CoreNLP.  Rename (move) the directory
found in the zip archive to ``~/corenlp`` to allow this package to find
it automatically. Alternatively, make a ``~/.corenlpyrc`` file and put
the following line in it, specifying the path to the CoreNLP directory:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {"corenlp_path": "path/to/the/corenlp/unzipped/dir"}

To run corenlp on all the files in "my_dir", you would do something like 
this:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import corenlpy as c
    >>> c.corenlp('path/to/my_dir')

The output (xml) files will be written to the same directory by default.

You can control how CoreNLP is run using various keyword arugments.  You 
can specify one or more input directories, or one or more input files, and
set a different output directory.  You can choose different output formats,
set the number of concurrent threads, and pass in 
`"properties file" options <http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/cmdline.html>`_ (see subheading "Configuration") using a dict.  The following
examples illustrate these options

First, you can specify one or more input directories, one or more 
specific input file paths, and the output directory:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> c.corenlp(
            in_dirs=['path/to/dir1', 'path/to/dir2'],
            in_files=['path/to/some/file1', 'path/to/some/file2'],
            out_dir='path/to/output_direcoty'
        )

Note that ``in_dirs`` can be a single directory or a list thereof, and
``in_files`` can be a single file or a list thereof.  When directories
are provided, CoreNLP will be invoked on *all* files within them.

To control the kinds of annotations applied by CoreNLP, the number of 
concurrent threads used, and the output format, do something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> c.corenlp(
            in_files="path/to/my_file",
            annotators=['tokenize', 'ssplit', 'pos', 'lemma', 'ner', 'parse', 'dcoref'],
            threads=4,
            output_format="xml"
        )

See the `list of available annotators <http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/annotators.html>`_.  The default output format is xml, 
and this is the format that the ``AnnotatedText`` class is designed to use. 
Other formats you can use are ``'json'``, ``'conll'``, ``'conllu'``, 
``'text'``, and ``'serialized'``, as explained `here <http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/cmdline.html>`_.

CoreNLP also allows you to specify other options via a properties file
(see `here <http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/cmdline.html>`_ under
the subheading "Configuration").
When invoking using the Python function, you can provide the same options
as a dictionary of key-value pairs.  The key should be the property
(what appears on the left of the equals sign in a properties file) and the 
value should be a string representation of everything on the right of the 
equals sign.  In this example, a specific NER model us specified:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> c.corenlp(
            'path/to/my_file',
            properties={'ner.model':'edu/stanford/nlp/models/ner/english.conll.4class.distsim.crf.ser.gz'}
        )

Note that the number of threads and the annotators to be applied can be
set using their keyword arguments, or they can be set in the properties
dict, with the value in the properties dict taking precedence.

AnnotatedText
------------
The ``AnnotatedText`` class is what originally motivated the creation of
this package.  If you need to work with annotation outputs from CoreNLP
in Python, this will save you a lot of time.  It's best to illustrate how
it works using an example.

Example
-------

Suppose we have the one-sentence document:

   *President Obama cannot run for a third term (but I think he wants to).*

Let's assume that it has been processed by CoreNLP, creating the output 
file ``obama.txt.xml``.  

Instantiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first thing we do is import the module and get an ``AnnotatedText`` 
object.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from corenlpy import AnnotatedText as A
   >>> xml = open('obama.txt.xml').read()
   >>> annotated_text = A(xml)

Sentences
~~~~~~~~~
Usually you'll access parts of the document using the ``sentences`` list.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> len(annotated_text.sentences)
   1
   >>> sentence = annotated_text.sentences[0]
   >>> sentence.keys()
   ['tokens', 'entities', 'references', 'mentions', 'root', 'id']


A ``Sentence`` is a special class that, for the most part, feels like a 
simple ``dict``.  

The ``tokens`` property is a list of the sentence's tokens:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> obama = sentence['tokens'][1]
   >>> obama
   ' 0: Obama (10,14) NNP PERSON'
   >>> term = sentence['tokens'][7]
   >>> term
   ' 7: term (39,42) NN -'

Tokens
~~~~~~
Tokens have properties corresponding to CoreNLP's annotations, plus some 
other stuff:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> obama.keys()
   ['word', 'character_offset_begin', 'character_offset_end', 'pos', 
   'lemma', 'sentence_id', 'entity_idx', 'speaker', 'mentions', 'parents', 
   'ner', 'id']


Named Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Obama" is the name of a person, so, if CoreNLP is working well, it should
pick that up.  Named entity information is found in the ``ner`` property:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> obama['ner']
   'PERSON'
   >>> term['ner'] is None
   True

POS Tags
~~~~~~~~
Similarly we can check the part-of-speech:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> obama['pos']
   'NNP'
   >>> term['pos']
   'NN'

Dependency Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We can traverse the dependency tree using the ``parents`` and ``children``
properties.  In our example, "run" is the parent of "Obama" 
(because "Obama" is the subject (``nsubj``) of "run"):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> relation, parent = obama['parents'][0]
    >>> relation
    u'nsubj'
    >>> parent
    ' 3: run (23,25) -'

If you're processing dependency trees, you'll often want to start with
the head word (which is like the root of the sentence).  Sentences have a
special ``root`` property that stores the head word.  Usually it's a verb:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> sentence['root']
   ' 3: run (23,25) -'

Coreference Chains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A coreference chain is a series of references to the same entity.  In our 
example, "President Obama" and "he" are each *mentions* from the same
coreference chain.  We can access all the mentions of a coreference chain.

First, we can get the mention that "Obama" is part of:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> first_mention = obama['mentions'][0]
    >>> first_mention['tokens']
    [' 0: President (0,8) -', ' 1: Obama (10,14) PERSON']

Note that a token can be part of multiple mentions.  For example, consider
the phrase "Obama's pyjamas".  If his pyjamas are mentioned multiple times,
then there will be a coreference chain made for it, as well as for Obama
himself.  And in the phrase "Obama's pyjamas", the token "Obama" is both 
part of a mention corresponding to the 44th President of the United States,
and part of a mention corresponding to some garments for sleeping.

Once we have gotten ahold of a mention, we can access the coreference
chain that it belongs to, which is found in the mention's ``'reference'`` 
property.  Conversely, if we have accessed a coreference chain, we can
find all of its mentions by looking at its ``'mentions'`` property.

So,  starting from the mention containing the token "Obama", we can get
to the other mention ("he") like this:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> reference = first_mention['reference']
   >>> len(reference['mentions'])
   2
   >>> second_mention = reference['mentions'][1]
   >>> second_mention['tokens']
   ['12: he (57,58) -']

Mentions have various properties:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> first_mention.keys()
   ['head', 'end', 'reference', 'tokens', 'start', 'sentence_id']

In addition to the coreference chain (``'reference'``), we get the id of 
the sentence in which the mention is found, the list
of token objects in the mention, the slice indices 
(``'start'`` and ``'end'``) for those tokens as they occur in the 
sentence's token list, and the head token of the 
mention.

References have various properties too:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> reference.keys()
   ['mentions', 'id', 'representative']

In addition to the mentions that are part of the coreference chain, we
get an id for the coreference chain (unique on a per-article-basis), 
and a reference to the
"representative" mention.  The representative mention is the one that is
deemed to have the fullest realization of the object's name.  So in our
example, the representative reference would be "President Obama", not "he".
This is useful for getting the human-readable name to represent the
coreference chain.

We can access all of the mentions or all of the coreference chains, for 
a given sentence, using its ``mentions`` and ``references`` properties. 

.. code-block:: python

    >>> len(sentence['mentions'])
    2
    >>> len(sentence['references'])
    1

One thing to note is that mentions and references aren't necessarily 
anchored to any named entity (though they often are). 
For example, consider this sentence:

   *The police are yet to find any suspects.  They say they will continue 
   their search.*

Here, "The police", "they" (which occurs twice), and "their" are all 
part of one coreference chain, yet none is a named entity.

To access *only* mentions that are named entities, use the ``entities`` 
property of the sentence.

The document as a whole also provides global ``mentions``, ``references``,
and ``entities`` properties which can be iterated over directly..

Reference
---------
.. py:class:: AnnotatedText(corenlp_xml, **kwargs)

   Create a new AnnotatedText object.  Only the first parameter is normally
   needed.  The remaining parameters enable adding entity linking data from
   the AIDA software, controlling the kind of dependency parse
   used, and filtering the kinds of named entities, coreference chains,
   and mentions that are included (by default all those provided by CoreNLP
   are are included).

   :param str corenlp_xml: An xml string output by CoreNLP.
   :param str aida_json=None: A JSON string output by AIDA.  AIDA is a program that disambiguates named entities, linking them to the YAGO knowledge base.  If the JSON output of AIDA is provided, then ``entities``, ``mentions`` and ``references`` entries will be augmented with entity linking information.
   :param str dependencies='collapsed-ccprocessed': Determines which kind of dependencies will be used in constructing dependency trees.  Three options are available: ``'collapsed-ccprocessed'`` (the default), ``'collapsed'``, and ``'basic'``.
   :param bool exclude_ordinal_NERs=False: Whether to recognize ordinal named entities.  If ``True``, named entities of the following types will be ignored: ``'TIME'``, ``'DATE'``, ``'NUMBER'``, ``'DURATION'``, ``'PERCENT'``, ``'SET'``, ``'ORDINAL'``, and ``'MONEY'``.
   :param bool exclude_long_mentions=False: CoreNLP occaisionally includes mentions, as part of coreference chains, that are very long noun phrases.  These mentions can be surprising and are often not useful.  Setting this option to ``True`` causes any mentions longer that the value specified by ``long_mention_threshold`` to be discarded (default length is 5 tokens).
   :param int long_mention_threshold=5: Maximum number of tokens allowed in a coreference chain mention, above which the mention will be ignored if ``exclude_long_mentions`` is ``True``.
   :param bool exclude_non_ner_coreferences=False: In some cases, it is only desirable to consider those coreference chains that have at least one named entity as a mention.  Setting this option to ``True`` will exclude references and their mentions if the reference includes no named entities.
